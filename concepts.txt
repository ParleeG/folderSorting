In Javascript a function acts like a variable
for example:-        
let sayHi=function(){
    console.log("sayHi function says Hi")
}

CallBack Function => Function which are passed as a argument in a function
for example:-
function callback(){
    console.log("I am passed as a argument")
    return 5
}
highOrderFunction(callback)


High Order Function => Function which accepts functions as a argument
for example:-
function highOrderFunction(cb){
    let value =cb();
    console.log(value)
}

fs -> File System

require is used to import the module in  the node
for example:- 
fs=require("fs")

fs.readFileSync(path,encoding) => used to read the data synchronsly from the file provided in the path
variable and by using the encoding

fs.writeFileSync(path,data) => used to write the data synchronsly to the file path provide in the path
variable 

we cannot import the whole Javascript file to the another file

for every javascript file it have the module.exports object which is an empty object used to export the 
variables to another file
